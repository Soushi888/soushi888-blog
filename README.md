# create-svelte

Personal Hive blog created with [Svelte Kit](https://kit.velte.dev) and the JS librairie [@hiveio/dhive](https://developers.hive.io/tutorials/#tutorials-javascript).

## Developing

Start a development server:

```bash
yarn run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
yarn run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
